# MinetestAuthVerifier
Compare Minetest database passwords with verifiers generated using username, password, and salt.
To use copy file "srp-test-py3.py" and the Minetest "auth.sqlite" file to the same directory, then edit the username and password variables in "srp-test-py3.py" to the username and password you would like to verify. Run the script and you will get a True or False if everything goes well.
